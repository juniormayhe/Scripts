# Business flows

## Diagrams as code

The motivation for choosing to document business flows with [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) diagrams is because its format:

- provides cross-platform and portable source code that can be viewed and edited on websites or plugins.
- helps to document as code the interactions between applications to be easily reviewed by engineers and versioned with git flow.
- prevents engineers from using mouse-based tools like Confluence or 3rd party tools to design static diagrams that can be hard to find and maintain.
- can help automation teams create tools or scripts around business processes documented as code. For example, scripts could define SLOs for a particular business flow already documented in PlantUML.
